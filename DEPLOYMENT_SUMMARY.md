## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### Railway Optimization

1. **Nixpacks Configuration**

   - Uses Node.js 18.x runtime
   - PNPM for frontend (faster installs)
   - NPM for backend (production optimized)
   - Automated build process
   - Dynamic PORT configuration

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Backend uses `${{PORT}}`, `${{FRONTEND_SERVICE_URL}}`
   - Frontend uses `${{BACKEND_SERVICE_URL}}/api`
   - All variables documented in `railway.env.example`

3. **Build Optimization**

   - Frontend: Code splitting, minification, tree-shaking
   - Backend: Production-only dependencies
   - Exclusion of unnecessary files via `.railwayignore`

4. **Deployment Workflow**
   - Two-service architecture (Frontend + Backend)
   - Independent scaling capability
   - Health check endpoints
   - Automatic restarts on failure

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start

1. **Fork/Clone Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vivid-valid
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**

   - Option A: Use Railway Dashboard (recommended)
   - Option B: Use Railway CLI
   - Option C: Use deployment script `./railway-deploy.sh`

3. **Configure Services**

   - Backend: Set root directory to `/backend`
   - Frontend: Set root directory to `/` (project root)

4. **Set Environment Variables**

   - Use `railway.env.example` as reference
   - Configure in Railway dashboard
   - Use Railway template variables for service URLs

5. **Generate Public Domains**
   - Backend: Generate domain for API access
   - Frontend: Generate domain for web access

### Deployment Script Usage

```bash
# Make script executable (already done)
chmod +x railway-deploy.sh

# Run deployment helper
./railway-deploy.sh

# Follow interactive prompts
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Services won't start**

   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify `nixpacks.toml` is in correct location
   - Review logs in Railway dashboard

2. **Frontend can't reach backend**

   - Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` includes `/api`
   - Check backend has public domain
   - Ensure CORS allows frontend URL

3. **Build failures**
   - Check `nixpacks.toml` configuration
   - Verify all dependencies in `package.json`
   - Review build logs for errors

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ✅ Both services deployed without errors
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Frontend accessible via public URL
- ✅ Backend API responding correctly
- ✅ Email validation working
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ Rate limiting active
- ✅ CORS properly configured
